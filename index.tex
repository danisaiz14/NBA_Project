\subsubsection{Introduction and Related
Work}\label{introduction-and-related-work}}

On the project proposal we formulated 3 different questions. We decide
to answer the second one about the gap between east and west
conferences.

One of our member followed for years the NBA and during that period of
time the Western conference teams ruled the league with Golden State
Warriors on the head. Only the Cleveland Cavaliers and Miami Heat,
thanks to LeBron James could fight against the best western team. During
the last 8 seasons, LeBron James won 4 rings (3 with Miami Heats and 1
with Cleveland Cavaliers) and played 7 finals.

LeBron James is one of the best players in the NBA history, and he is
able to lead a whole team to the victory almost by himself, but this is
not the case with any other player of the league at this moment. LeBron
moved to Los Angeles Lakers on the last season, and the project wasn't
complete, which is one of the reasons to select the season 2018/2019 to
avoid an outlier on the eastern team where LeBron is playing.

To check if we were sure about our assumptions, we loaded the Match
Statistics Dataset and performed several transformations to retrieve the
data we wanted.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lr@{}}
\toprule
Conference & Wins\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
EAST & 198\tabularnewline
WEST & 252\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

It seems like the gap between the West and the East is still there, but
with this simple table we cannot be sure the data is not biased by low
performing teams. To check this we plotted the wins against teams of the
same conference and teams of the other, clustering the results by
conferences. The script which generates the following chart can be found
\href{https://github.com/AlmaProcesses/NBA_Project/blob/master/question_2.R}{here}

\includegraphics{index_files/figure-latex/patchwork-1.pdf}

We can see how West teams perform better than East ones on the cross
matches. The eastern team with the most victories during the regular
season was Toronto Raptors, which finally won the playoffs finals
against Golden State Warriors. With this visualization we can assure the
West conference was stronger than the East conference during the season
2018/2019.

Here you will find several relevant work about this question that we
want to answer:

from the official \href{https://stats.nba.com/}{NBA API} and different
pages containing NBA historic data like

datasets:

and magnitude of the relationships. This can be presented in a table or
chart, and pertinent observations should be described in the text.
(\textbf{10 points}) - \textbf{Predictions}: How well were you able to
predict values in the dataset? You should both report appropriate

the strength of your model (\textbf{10 points})
